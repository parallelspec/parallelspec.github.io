The Third of March, Seventeen Thirty-Nine

Dear my faithful friend,

My name is Beanius. I'm a detective, so call me Detective Beanius, DB for short. If you are receiving this message, it means I am dead. I am saddened too.

However, this is not the key issue I present to you, my faithful friend. On the first day of our year and lord, 1739, I was onboard a ship towards the End of the World, heading true south from the Africas. The ship was captained by a French fellow, whose name I no longer remember. I had been on the ship for the past several months, taking notes of the passengers and views that jointly embarked and disembarked.

At approximately 11:00 time, according to my pocket watch, the captain, in his very French accent, proclaimed:

> nous sommes arrivÃ©s, mes amis!

It was then all the occupants of the ship climbed were on the top deck. We saw a marvellous, white creature, covered in pure snow. A sight to behold, a site to befriend. Except though, my faithful friend, that this creature was dormant. Bare, bloodless, bleak. An island filled with snow. 

With nowhere to port on this island (being riddled with impassable rock), our poor French captain decided to sail back towards France. On the way back to France, from Africa, we ended up in a terrible rip; waves thundering and crashing, with torrential rainfall helping us. It was a noisy night. I could not sleep, nor could anyone else. 

Waking up, I checked my watch. It was 01:30. I was, presumedly, the last one to awake from their slumber, for I counted eighteen heads in the cabin deck. The nineteenth, supposedly, was outside directing the ship, being the French captain he was. No compass would save him here, I thought.

A couple of minutes go by. The relentless rainfall continued to fall on our shoulders, for it had crept through the cracks of the deck. A pleasant shower, if it was not for the sub-zero temperatures. At least it felt like it, for we could see the ghosts of our voices linger around with every breath we took. 

> ...for every breath we take...could be the last we make...

An odd line stemming from a conversation I overheard from the corner of my ears. A female voice, could not be more than thirty. A sudden crash of waves follows. Lightning strikes. The perfect time for a murder, in the midst of the moonless night. 

> AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHH...

A brilliant French scream forced upon us. No doubt, the captain. We all rushed towards the top deck. His lifeless body, swinging on top of the wheel.

On the ship there were six persons of interest: Cartius, Manny, Nana, Mr. Rose, Sir Battler, and myself; the Great Detective Beanius. The rest of the crew, totalling twelve, do not play a part in this story, my faithful friend. However, summing them up, we thus have **19** members on board, including the French captain.
