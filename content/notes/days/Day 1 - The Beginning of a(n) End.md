title: "Day 1 - The Beginning of a(n) End"
---

Welcome, travellers! 

This is the first day (of many, hopefully!) of your wonderful adventure and the start of legends! At the moment, the calendar is looking pretty much empty, but this will soon change as you continue through the storyline and make decisions that may or may not be irreversible...much like real life. 

As we continue through the days, we will be writing out the events that unfold here, in each day-page. For example, you're currently on [[days/Day 1 - The Beginning of a(n) End|Day 1]]. Each day will have a cool sounding name, so it doesn't become too monotonous and uninteresting. Whether the names mean anything...I Guess We'll (eventually) Know.

As for who we are - I'm just a scribe sent to document your events. Don't worry about who I am, or where I am - you'll **never** spot me.
