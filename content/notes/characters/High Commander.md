The High Commander (HC) is the de-facto leader, ruler, dictator, president, tyrant, God, of Sariel. Since the very beginning of time, or what we know of it, the HC system has been in effect on Sariel.

The HC wears a crown, made out of [[notes/world/misc/Xertanium|Xertanium]], an ultra-rare mineral that has yet to be found on Sariel. Rumours suggest it's found in the other heavenly bodies around Sariel, but I don't really know how trustworthy it is. The crown itself is infused into the skull of the HC, unable to be pried out without certain death of the HC. 

In the past, prospecting HCers would battle it out to the death, but this was recently replaced with a democractic voting system, with the candidates being the best that each major [[notes/world/regions/Regions of Sariel|region]] has to offer. 

The HC doesn't have any special powers, but any disobeyment of their command (whilst the crown is on) will result in instant death. After 5 years, the crown eventually eats the brain of the HC, killing them.
