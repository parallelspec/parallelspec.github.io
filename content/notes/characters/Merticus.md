Merticus is what happens when you combine stupidity with stupidly good luck - a former spy of the Santos Legion who clumsily rose up the ranks to become Sultanate of [[notes/world/regions/Santeaux|Santeaux]]. The exact specifics on his climb to greatness is not known, but he is known to be able to charm even the coldest heart - including those who don't have a heart. 

Merticus is a human bard with a spy background.

Merticus is a human bard with a spy background, owing from his many years working in the intelligence department.
	* Not much is known, if not at all about his childhood and upbringing. Virtually all government records were expunged once he became Chief Spy Officer 5 years ago. 
	* Very likely we will never recover these records 
	* He is around 172cm tall, skinny build, with long wavy hair
	* Around 31 years old 
	* Claims to be 25 but sources are unverifiable.
	* Don't trust a thing this man says 
	* Is he even a man??? 
	* ???

<h2>Actions</h2> 
Clueless Whisper | lvl X 
- Merticus sends a whisper into a living mind. The target affected can always understand what Merticus says. There is a 45% chance that the target becomes stunned from confusion. Saving throw: 15 INT/15 WIS. If not stunned, then nothing else happens.

CopyCat | lvl X
* Merticus shape-shifts into a target that he has recently touched (3 business days). This process is instantaneous and undetectable by all sense other than vision. Merticus fully envelops himself as the target, with the exception of personality, for which Merticus retains his own. Merticus can perform any action whilst in CopyCat. This disguise can only be broken if Merticus decides to break the spell or if he dies. 

The Eternal Reward | lvl x
* Merticus can stab with his dagger for 1d4 + 8 damage. This can be boosted if the target is facing away from Merticus at the time, to 1d20 + 8 damage. On a successful stab, Merticus can activate CopyCat instantly.
