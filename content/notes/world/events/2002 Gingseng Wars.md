The 2002 Gingseng Wars were a series of conflicts relating to the procurement of Gingseng, yes that gingseng. In 1994, second last Era, the [[notes/characters/High Commander|High Commander]] at the time declared that Gingseng was to be used as the main currency of Sariel. 

His plan was simple: gather as much gingseng as possible, then declare a change of currency, since his word was unopposable. Whilst this sounds like a genius idea, this was anything but - his reserves of gingseng became useless after the [[notes/world/entities/Prima Lux]] company dedicated a million km squared of gingseng growing. Nice one, buddy. Dude didn't take basic economics in college clearly loooooooool. 

As such, the HC declared war upon Prima Lux, in 2002. Hence the name, 2002 Gingseng Wars. It ended up being a series of smaller battles which didn't result in much, since Prima Lux just bribed the HC's personal army. 

This resulted in the pre-mature death of the HC, who had nothing but gingseng. The sludge that is currently on Santos, is actually toxic gingseng. There are some things that I do not wish to explain to you, like how does gingseng become a toxic brown sludge.
