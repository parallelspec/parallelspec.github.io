To avoid making dozens of pages this is a list of the most popular races on Sariel (that we know exist). Unless otherwise noted, there is currently no way for any two races to have a child naturally (i.e. naturally occurring )

<i>In no particular order</i> 
* Humans: the most populous race out of them all, humans are the key backbone of modern Sariel society. Birthed by evolution, it took humans millennia to become what we see today. They are around 50% of the Sariel population, with humans coming in various skin tones and body types. Around half of the known list of [[notes/characters/High Commander|High Commanders]] were human. 

* Elves: they're basically human but taller, older, slenderer (lol), and have funny pointy ears. They are mostly concentrated in cities scattered in northern Sariel, regardless of region or area. There is not too much difference, except there has been rumours of an Elven uprising to decapitate the current HC. 

* sample text


There are some other races, but either 1) little information exists and 2) unknown races may be found on some islands.
