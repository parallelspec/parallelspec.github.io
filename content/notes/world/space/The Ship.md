<h2>Your Home away from Home</h2>
The Ship (formally known as the *Discovery One*) is your home in this foreign land. Its distinct features and "un-[[notes/world/regions/Regions of Sariel|Sariel]]" mechanics have prompted curiosity, but nothing hostile...yet...

It comes with just enough sleeping cabins for everyone except for the captain, who just sleeps on the main deck's sofa. Remnants of Earth are scattered around.
