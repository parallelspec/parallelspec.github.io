Sariel consists of three, mega-large landmasses that were formed over time

Above: rough sketch of Sariel, flat projection (but the world itself is not flat!)
There is terrain and some settlements, but they have been removed for clarity.

The left region, [[Renova]], is ruled by the [[Prima Lux]] company. Prima Lux's main business is selling agricultural products to the rest of the world, given the vast fertile land they have. 

The top right region, [[Mora]], is owned by the [[New Triton]] corporation. Their main business is minerals - being the only region with access to mega mineral deposits (northern side of Mora in grey). Holding a monopoly on minerals, the wealthy citizens of Mora enjoy perhaps the greatest living standards on Sariel. 

The bottom right region, [[Santeaux]], is controlled by the [[LaAmour]] family. It is by far the worst region to live in, with the vast majority of the region being muddled in toxic gingseng sludge, a direct result of the [[notes/world/events/2002 Gingseng Wars|2002 Gingseng Wars]]. The LaAmour family is the last remaining family stemming from the [[Old Aristocracy]] era, some 5,000 years ago. 

There are many small islands of varying sizes; most are uninhabited since they are too small and contain relics of past habitation attempts. However, the larger ones on the left of the map (west) are inhabited, but we do not know much about them. Some things are left better unknown, no? 

The one which I will reveal to you is called [[K'mani]]. It's the big-ish desert island south of Renova, west of Santeaux. This area is special, for it's where the crown of the [[notes/characters/High Commander|High Commander]] was first found millennia ago. Right now, the tribe of the [[notes/characters/clans/Novi|Novi]] people live there, and refuse to contact any outsiders.

Sariel does have ice polar caps, both north and south. These are not illustrated as they do not serve any function in this situation.
