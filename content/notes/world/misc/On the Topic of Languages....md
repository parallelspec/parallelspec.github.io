Sariel is a vibrant world with an equally vibrant population - the vast majority of the world speaks Common. However, many non-humanoid races speak it as their second+ language. Their first language depends on their race - dragon-born speaks...dragonese? idk dude 

Rumours suggest that there is an unknown language that all living beings understand whilst on Sariel, but that has been lost to the ages and eras...
